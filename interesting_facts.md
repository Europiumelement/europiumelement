4. Britannica states that, "A total of 34 (excluding nuclear isomers) radioactive isotopes, varying in mass from 130 to 165 and having half lives as short as 0.9 millisecond (europium-130) and as long as 36.9 years (europium-150), have been characterized."
5. Material Properties states that "Europium is one of the least abundant elements in the universe. Only about 5×10-8% of all matter in the universe is europium."

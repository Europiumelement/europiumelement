# Europium

When I began research for Europium, I was entirely unfamiliar with the element. I chose it because of my unfamiliarity with it and the fact that it seemed to contain "Europe in its name." As I researched this element, I found how much information there is to discover about an element, no matter how prominent it is in our daily lives.

**Initial information about Europium may be found [here](./initial_information.md).** 

**Europium in Bohr Models may be found [here](./europium_in_bohr_models.md).**

**Reactivity, electronegativity, and compounds that include Europium may also be found [here](./additional_information.md).**

**Information in relation to Europium's emission spectra may be found [here](./emission_spectra.md).**

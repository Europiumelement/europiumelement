# Europium's Emission Spectra
![Europium Emission Spectra](http://umop.net/spectra/images/Eu.png?1655151047)

Europium would possibly produce a color of blue green, red, or orange or some collection of those colors. It may be such because there are the brightest or most frequent or densest collection of lines arond the regions of 415 to 750 nanometers, 510 to 560 nanometers, and 590 to 650 nanometers on the emission spectra. These portions of the emission spectra appear to be the regions which may produce the colors of dark blue or violet, light blue and light green, and orange and red or slightly pink.

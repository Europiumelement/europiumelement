### Electronegativity
Webelements.com states that Europium has an electronegativity value of 1.01 in Allred Rochow electronegativity, but does not provide an electronegativity value for Pauling electronegativity. The Royal Society of Chemistry states that the electronegativity of Europium is unknown. Georgia State University appears to state that Europium has an electronegativity value of 1.2.

### Compounds
Europium is part of the Europium oxide compound, with a formula of Eu2O3. Europium oxide is used "as a red phosphor in television sets," according to Pubchem and JLab.

### Reactivity
Europium is "the most reactive of the rare-earth metals," as stated by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and it may be quite reactive because Europium contains a large quantity of electron shells and electrons are able to reach high electron levels in their excited state because of the large quantity of electron shells. It may also be because Europium contains a relatively large quantity of electrons within each of its shells that electrons may more easily absorb energy or be required to travel to higher electron shells because they contain less electrons.

Europium is located in the relative middle of the periodic table because some elements within the same group of Europium also seem to contain two valence electrons within the valence shell, as does Europium. The element Lanthanum, located on the left of the Lanthanide series on the periodic table, appears to contain 18 electrons in its third outermost electron shell and Ytterbium, located on the right of the Lanthanide series on the periodic table, appears to contain 32 electrons in its third outermost shell. Subtracting eighteen from thirty-two equals fourteen and fourteen divided in half equals seven. Seven plus eighteen would equal the value of electrons in the third outermost electron shell of the element in the middle of the Lanthanide series on the periodic table. Eighteen plus seven equals twenty-five, which appears to equal the value of the electrons within the third outermost electron shell of Europium. As such, it may make sense why Europium may be located within the middle of the Lanthanide series on the periodic table.
